// Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power. 
//   * For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on).


//  * The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture.
//     The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.

//   The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game the game if their character's `HP` falls to zero or below.


// When the player's HP is reduced to zero, game over
